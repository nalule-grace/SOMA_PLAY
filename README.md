# SOMA PLAY -MVP



## Description
Soma Play is an AR-enhanced board game that is designed to teach children aged 6-12 foundational STEM concepts. Players interact with physical game cards that, when scanned using a mobile app built with unity + AR foundation, trigger immersive 3D experiences, quizzes, animations an deducational prompts. The game integrates both hardware (board, cards, dice) and software (AR app, 3d assets), designed with a strong user-centric approach.
